If someone is trying to get my information.
They can trying hacking through the network am using.
They will try and get my IP address.
This is like one of the easiest way hack someone.
You can even perform this attack straight from you phone with some software.
Soft wares like Man in the Middle attack is very command with people. It is performed through Wi-Fi.

They can try direct attack as well.
If they get access to my laptop they  will try and crack.
Most people use command line to perform a direct attack on someone.
They other way people could use is by using USB to just gather all the information.
That is kind of the easiest way but you will have to make the USB.
So that is why I never my password in Chrome or any kind of browser.

The last is by spying on me or using some sort of information of mine.
They could spying on me by using like my E-mail account.
This most of the time gives the hacker what they need to hack me.
This is not easy and takes time to perform this attack.

So all am  trying to say is that we shouldn't think all we do on our computers or phone.
I can be cracked in many different ways. All the things I just listed are possible ways that I can get cracked.
